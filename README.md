OnsNieuws
=========

**PLEASE NOTE:** This app was never released, due to not being able to monotize. There are some bugs still, mainly with regards to caching data IIRC. I wasn't allowed to monotize on this app due to NOS news gathering is payed for with public money.

_Ons Nieuws_ is a simple app that demonstrates some techniques used in iPhone projects. Feel free to use fragments of the code in your own projects, though one is not allowed to publish the whole project on the AppStore. 

So, what could an aspiring iOS programmer learn from this project?
- Proper use of a _Singleton_ (see: AudioPlayer)
- Extending existing classes with new functionality through _Categories_.
- Notifications / NotificationCenter
- Using the _Strategy_ pattern to choose the right algorithm depending on the situation (see: *Parser classes)
- Programming readable Objective-C (style).
- Archiving / unarchiving data using NSCoder.
- Integrate Facebook into an app.
